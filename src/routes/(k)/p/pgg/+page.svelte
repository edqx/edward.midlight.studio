    Polus.GG was a large modding project for the video game Among Us created by some members of the
    community in 2021, in which I joined later in late August. While my time there was short, I was active
    during the most chaotic and volatile part of the project, in which I continued to add features with the
    team.
    <br><br>
    The actual project was cut short due to several complex reasons, but it was a great experience for me
    working with a larger team and with artists.

    Towards the end of my time at Polus.GG, I had begun working on a rewrite of the entire project solo,
    which I codenamed "Mouthwash". I ended up cutting this short too as an update to the game set back my progress
    by a lot.
    <br><br>
    However, in 2023, I decided to revive Polus.GG: Rewritten, initially using the same version of the game as
    before the update that set my progress back. This was an enormous task, as I put myself in task of rewriting
    even more of the Polus.GG codebase, including an entirely new launcher, load-balancer, as well as several
    more gamemodes and, later, a new client for the latest version of the game.
