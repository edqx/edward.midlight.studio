    <span slot="name">Tailwind</span>
    <span slot="time">Since 2022</span>

    I've used Tailwind to almost exclusively replace most of my work with CSS since I've started using it,
    using it in most of my more recent websites (including this one) and HTML-based desktop app.<br><br>
    <span class="text-2xl">WindiCSS</span>
    <br>
    I've also used <a href="https://windicss.org/">WindiCSS</a> to make use of much faster compilation as
    well as additional features not originally supported in Tailwind, while keeping a largely compatible syntax.
