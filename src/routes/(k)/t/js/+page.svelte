    <span slot="name">JavaScript</span>
    <span slot="time">Since 2016</span>

    JavaScript was the first language I used after <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, around the age of 11.
    <br><br>
    I am very proficient in JavaScript, as it's the language I am most comfortable with and work best with. I have used
    it basically everywhere you can find it (as per <a href="https://jayaprabhakar.medium.com/rethinking-atwoods-law-64a894b54aa4">Atwood's Law</a>),
    using Node.JS, Deno, <a href="/t/tauri">Tauri</a>, <a href="/t/electron">Electron</a>, on the web, etc.
    <br><br>
    <span class="text-2xl">TypeScript</span>
    <br>
    I found <a href="https://typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> through the YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCwqrYpIuM">Fireship</a>
    as well as some friends who were also using it.
    <br><br>
    I found that TypeScript completely and permanently changed the way I thought about and wrote JavaScript, and overall it was the best change I ever
    made to my workflow.
