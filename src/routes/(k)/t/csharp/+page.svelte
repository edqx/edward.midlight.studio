    <span slot="name">C#</span>
    <span slot="time">Since 2022</span>

    I have recently started using C# for writing mods for games using <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx">BepInEx</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony">Harmony</a>.
    <br><br>
    My <a href="/p/pgg">mods for Among Us</a> were written in C#, and one mod I made for Terraria was also written in C# using
    <a href="https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader">tModLoader</a>.
    <br><br>
    Additionally, I have used C# with Unity to make games as well as the demo for <a href="/p/edith">Edith</a>.
