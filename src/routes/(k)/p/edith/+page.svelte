    <span slot="name">Edith</span>
    <span slot="time">Since 2022</span>

    Edith is by far my most ambitious project, and I am working on it with a friend who is responsible
    for the artwork as well as the story with me. Initially, I was using <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>
    for it, however due to some changes in the management at Unity as well as some personal dissatisfaction with
    it, I have since decided to take up the task of making my own specialised engine for the project, <a href="/p/constellation">Constellation</a>.
    <br><br>
    The scope for Edith is vast compared to all of my other projects, it is an ambition that will take
    years to fulfil and will require lots of work in both story design and tools. Constellation was created
    to help me and my other team member to quickly design, prototype and ultimately produce entire conversations,
    cutscenes, fights, maps, item behaviours, shaders, and any other aspects of the game without writing a single
    line of code.
    <br><br>
    In terms of technical specifics, Edith aims to have a fully 3d lighting system with weather and dynamic puddles,
    audio and shaders depending on in-game time. The new engine will use the <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>
    programming language, with a web-based real-time editor that focuses on user-friendliness and accessibility.
