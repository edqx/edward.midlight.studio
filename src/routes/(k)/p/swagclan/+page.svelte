    SwagClan was a bot for the chat platform <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a>, and was one
    of my smaller projects for myself and a few others.
    <br><br>
    Even though it was small, it still had high ambitions and had some features only found in some of the
    most popular Discord bots, for example custom commands for server admins to write their own commands
    that could make use of permanent key-value storage specifically for their server.
